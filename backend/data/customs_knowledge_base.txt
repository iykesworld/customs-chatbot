Nigeria Customs Service (NCS) Internal Policy and Trade Reference Manual
Last Updated: Q3 2024

====================================================================
SECTION 1: OVERVIEW OF THE NCS ACT 2023 AND CLEARANCE TIMELINES
====================================================================

The Nigeria Customs Service Act (NCSA) 2023 aims to streamline trade, improve corporate governance, and boost revenue generation.
A key provision of the Act is the establishment of a Governing Board to oversee general policies.

Cargo Clearance Timelines (NCSA 2023):
- Initial Clearance Period: Imported goods must be cleared within 30 days of arrival at the port.
- Overtime Cargo: Goods uncleared beyond 30 days are classified as "overtime" but may be cleared within an additional 30 days upon approval from the relevant customs controller.
- Disposal: Goods remaining uncleared for over 90 days from the arrival date are subject to official disposal by the NCS.
- Advance Ruling: Importers can apply for an Advance Ruling on tariff classification or valuation. The NCS must issue this ruling no later than 150 calendar days from receipt of the application.

====================================================================
SECTION 2: TARIFFS AND LEVIES ON USED MOTOR VEHICLES
====================================================================

Tariffs on imported used vehicles are calculated based on the Vehicle Identification Number (VIN) valuation system and are subject to the ECOWAS Common External Tariff (CET) structure.

Duty Structure for Used Vehicles (HS Code 8703):
- Import Duty: 20% of the Cost, Insurance, and Freight (CIF) value.
- National Automotive Council (NAC) Levy: 15% of the CIF value.
- Surcharge (SUR): 7.0% applied to the Import Duty amount.
- Value Added Tax (VAT): 7.5% of the total cleared value (CIF + Duty + Levy + other taxes).
- Other Taxes (ETL/IAT): Varying rates, e.g., 0.5% ETL.

Age Restriction:
Used vehicles older than 15 years from the year of manufacture are generally prohibited from import.

Example Calculation Note:
To calculate total payable customs duty, sum the Import Duty, NAC Levy, SUR, ETL, and VAT.
The current official exchange rate must be applied to the dollar-denominated VIN value.
